Question 02
-----------  
We have to write a program which calculates the pay of employees up to user says YES (i.e. input 'y'). For each employee, we have to also print the projected pay for coming 10 years. Clearly, the program will have nested loops. Now, of course, its upto the programmar that which loops (for or while) are used in the program. But, ideally, to make the program more elegant which of the loops should be used?
